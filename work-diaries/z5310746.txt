Week 1:
Formed team name (3900H18BGitGud) and general meeting time/scheduling. Assigned roles to each member (Scrum Master + assistance with backend, 
frontend if needed). Created user stories for user types and laid out corresponding functionalities and potential novel functions. I Started working 
on Jira, created sprints, uploaded user stories and started sections within the report. Brainstormed about methods for database and languages to code in. 

Week 2:
Adjusted many of our user stories based on tutors’ feedback and new content from lecturers. Began work on the story board and setting up of the database 
and backend systems. Laid out sprints and user stories for each sprint with more detail. I started on the proposal, researching problems with learning 
management systems and looked at similar style LMS such as Moodle. 

Week 3:
Finalised all user stories and storyboard. Adjusted the proposal to the changes and added more user stories to our novel functionality. Finalised 
and submitted project proposal, incorporated the architecture diagram and went more into depth about the projects’ objectives after more feedback.

Week 4:
Started setting up virtual box and confirming what tools to use for the frontend. Had some trouble setting up as moodle virtual box guide was not 
working for me. Downloaded and updated system to work for databases and backend. Started creating frontend, attempting to link between backend. 
Linked vscode to virtual box through laptop.
