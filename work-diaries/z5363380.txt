Week 1
During the lab, group formed and decided to do Learning Management System, roles assigned and Jira website created.
Also agreed on a weekly standup of 9:30 on Tuesday and Saturday.

Wrote most of the user stories and organised them into epics in Jira

Week 2
Adding user stories for admin and teacher(to seperate from lecturer), making adjustments to novel functionalities and add acceptance criteria to all user stories.
Will do figma storyboard for lecturer interfaces

new updates from writing user story acceptance criteria
-join course on course dashboard
-pending enrolment
-ways for student to join class

Week 3
Finilising proposal, many changes to user stories and novel functions, the scope for novel functions is much larger than better and completed all the acceptance
criteria for user stories in given/when/then style.

Week 4
Worked on the python backend for course and assignment system, still trying to understand how postgresql functions work.
Wrote some backend design and functions that we need that I want.
Resource and assignment system are pretty annoying.

Week 5
Many changes to the resource and assignment system, figured that instead of letting the backend handle file view and donwload its better to let the frontend convert
everything to base64 string and its easier for everyone.
Will probably delay the class system to after most of stuff are done because there are many duplicating functioanlities between course and class

Week 6
for sprint2:
token validity
resource now takes base64 string
class system
enrol lecturer/teacher to enrol request instead of free access

Week 7
Class system overhaul from being a seperate system to be a part of course system
